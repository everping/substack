# Substack

substack is an open source penetration testing tool that can discover sub-domains from a specific domain. This tool is based on the idea of listing search engine results. [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) also implemented this idea, but it was really hard to develop more features, so we decided to write a tool for ourselves.
